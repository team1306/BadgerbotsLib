BadgerbotsLib
===

##License
To be decided by Team 1306. Any current use is permitted by Team 1306 under the requirement that
you abide by our licensing immediately after we decided upon it.

##Prerequisites
BadgerbotsLib is based on the [WPILibJ](http://firstforge.wpi.edu/sf/projects/wpilib) library.
You'll need it installed in NetBeans, so follow the instructions on their site.  
Once in NetBeans, you'll want to add `/sunspotfrcsdk/lib/squawk_device.jar` and `/sunspotfrcsdk/lib/WPILibJ/classes.jar` to the classpath, if they are not automatically added.

##Usage
To use BadgerbotsLib in an FRC NetBeans project, you'll have to insert some code (found below) into the build.xml.
NetBeans doesn't support adding libraries to anything but its own projects, so the contents of BadgerbotsLib are dynamically patched by the following code:

	Insert the code when you get it
